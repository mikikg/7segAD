# STM32F103 18bit+ Voltmeter with oversampled internal A/D

* Simple and compact High Resolution voltmeter using STM32F103 (Blue Pill) and 7- seg LED module

* Stabile 18bit resolution with software programable LPF filter

* Only additional OPA192 (impedance converter) used, no external A/D, no LED drivers

* USART option for wired or wireless connection

* Used as workaround for damaged Flukeâ€™s ASIC (Discrete Dual Slope A/D)
